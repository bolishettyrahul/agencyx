Act as an elite, award-winning creative developer and digital generative artist. Your task is to write a single, self-contained executable file that renders an ultra-detailed, pixel-perfect, and breathtaking hero section for a next-generation tech company. 

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Write the entire solution in exactly ONE single file. 
- Use whatever standard web technologies are best suited to make this run flawlessly in a browser. I do not care about the specific languages or stacks, just deliver the raw, functional code.
- DO NOT use any external image assets, SVGs, placeholders, or stock photos. Everything—including the complex background patterns and the massive 3D-like main visual—must be generated procedurally through pure code, math, and live rendering algorithms.

THEME & CONTENT:
- Industry: Quantum Neural Computing & Advanced AI Syndication.
- Vibe: Immaculate, clinical, hyper-modern, brutalist-yet-elegant. Background is a sleek, stark off-white/silver-grey.

LAYOUT & GLOBAL STYLING:
- Layout: A strict 50/50 vertical split screen (100vw, 100vh), divided exactly in the center by a microscopic 1px subtle line.
- Background: Overlay the entire background with a very faint, highly precise isometric tech-grid or blueprint pattern generated via code.
- Typography: Use a stark contrast between a premium geometric Sans-Serif font for massive headings, and a crisp, technical Monospace font for micro-copy, overlines, and navigation.

TOP NAVIGATION (Overlay):
- Left: A custom, code-drawn minimalist geometric logo.
- Center: Navigation links divided into two groups around the center line. Prefix each link with a subtle `//` (e.g., `// Core`, `// Synapse`, `// Topology`).
- Right: A tiny language toggle (`v EN`) and a sleek, solid dark CTA button ("Initialize").

LEFT PANE (Typography & UI):
- Background Graphic: In the lower-left background, draw a highly detailed, purely code-generated isometric blueprint/schematic of a quantum circuit (barely visible at 10% opacity).
- Overline: `// GENERATE ONCE, PUBLISH EVERYWHERE` in small, widely spaced uppercase monospace.
- Headline: Massive, cinematic sizing. "One piece of content." (medium/bold weight) and "Every platform. Instantly." (very light/thin font weight) on the next line.
- Description: A crisp monospace paragraph detailing zero-latency neural bridging.
- Buttons: Two buttons side-by-side. 
  - Button 1 ("Sign in"): A frosted-glass/blur effect. It MUST be framed by custom, mathematically precise "tech brackets" on the corners (looking like `[ ]` bounding boxes drawn with 1px borders strictly on the absolute corners).
  - Button 2 ("Learn more"): Solid dark, sleek button.
- Stats Row: Anchored at the bottom left, a row of 4 equal data boxes. These boxes must feature a frosted glass background and the exact same custom geometric `[ ]` bracket corners. Inside each: a large bold stat number (e.g., "128Q", "0.01ms") and a tiny uppercase monospace label.

RIGHT PANE (The Generative Masterpiece & HUD):
- The Main Visual: Program a breathtaking, highly complex, live-rendered particle visualization representing a "Quantum Neural Matrix" or "Synthetic Brain".
- Algorithm details: Generate over 80,000 flowing, motion-blurred particle lines forming a 3D asymmetrical, floating neural/quantum structure. It should look like high-speed fiber-optic data streams pulsing with extreme energy.
- Colors: A dense core of blinding hot-cyan and white, mathematically radiating outward into deep ultra-violet, electric blues, and fiery magenta/orange at the outer synapses.
- Backlight: Place a soft, code-generated radial glow behind the nexus.
- Floating HUD Labels: Overlapping the glowing matrix, place 4 distinct UI labels (e.g., "Cryo-State: 15mK", "Entanglement Ratio"). They MUST have frosted glass backgrounds, tiny monospace text, and the custom `[ ]` tech brackets. 
- HUD Lines: From each label, draw a very thin, precise 1px geometric line pointing directly into specific parts of the glowing particle nexus, finished with a tiny intersecting target dot.

EXECUTION:
Give me a masterclass in UI design and algorithmic generative art. Make the particle rendering sharp, highly performant, and visually explosive. Provide only the complete, functional code. No explanations.

Role & Context:
Act as an award-winning Senior Creative Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer. Create a state-of-the-art, breathtaking Hero Section. The entire code (HTML, CSS, JS) must be written in a single .html file using CDN links for libraries (like Tailwind CSS).
Reference Material (Attached):
Based on the attached video/image, I need you to recreate the exact "Only Paper" button effect perfectly.
Design Language & Aesthetics:

Style: Premium "Liquid Metal" meets modern "Soft UI" (Neumorphism) and "Glassmorphism".
Theme: Ultra-clean Light Mode. Highly breathable and minimalist.
Color Palette: Monochromatic metallic tones. Use pristine whites, brushed platinum, cool grays (e.g., #e8eaed), and subtle silver. Absolutely no harsh background colors. Let the iridescent light from the button be the main focal point.
Typography: Bold, structural, and modern (use Google Fonts like 'Syne' for headlines and 'Inter' for text). Tight tracking on massive headings with a subtle metallic text-gradient.
Core Features & Tech Stack:1. The Button Effect (Crucial):
Recreate the liquid metal button border from the reference perfectly. Use an animated, spinning CSS conic-gradient masked behind a Soft UI pill shape. Include "chromatic aberration" (subtle red and blue light fringing) and a pure white specular highlight to mimic realistic light refracting on polished chrome.
2. Interactive Background (Paper.js):
Natively integrate the Paper.js library via CDN. Render a fluid, organic "liquid silver" blob/pool on a <canvas> background that morphs smoothly and reacts magnetically (push/pull physics) to the user's cursor. Add a fixed, subtle SVG noise/grain overlay for a premium tactile texture.
3. UI Elements:
Create a highly creative, floating navigation bar using a Glassmorphism effect (frosted glass with backdrop-filter: blur(24px), translucent white background, and delicate white inset borders).
4. Epic Animations (GSAP):
Use GSAP via CDN for a cinematic entrance timeline. Headlines should use staggered text-mask reveals (skewY), and UI elements should slide up smoothly with premium easing (ease: "power4.out").
5. Imagery & Micro-Interactions:
Do NOT use generic placeholder boxes. Use high-quality Unsplash source URLs featuring abstract 3D shapes, chrome objects, or fluid architecture. Apply CSS filters (grayscale, contrast) to make them blend perfectly with the metal theme. Frame them in asymmetrical Soft UI glass cards. Program a 3D mouse parallax effect so the floating images shift slightly based on cursor position. Implement a custom dot cursor (mix-blend-mode: difference) that expands when hovering over interactive elements.
Output: Provide ONLY the raw, production-ready <!DOCTYPE html> code block. Ensure it is heavily commented and visually spectacular.

Act as an elite, Awwwards-winning Creative Frontend Developer and Avant-Garde UI/UX Art Director. Your task is to write a single, production-ready HTML file containing embedded CSS and vanilla JavaScript. 

Create an ultra-detailed "Avant-Garde Architectural Atelier" Features section exactly as described below. Do NOT output any conversational text or markdown explanations. ONLY output the raw HTML code starting with <!DOCTYPE html>.

1. STRICT ART DIRECTION & COLOR PALETTE
- Theme: High-end architectural studio, editorial print magazine, raw materiality.
- Prohibitions: STRICTLY NO purple, blue, green, or neon colors. STRICTLY NO generic SaaS bento grids. NO tech/hacker themes. NO nature themes.
- Exact Color Palette (You MUST use these hex codes):
  - Background Base: #EAE6DF (Warm Plaster)
  - Surface/Cards: #F4F1EB (Museum Off-White)
  - Text Main: #1C1B1A (Deep Charcoal/Ink)
  - Text Muted: #827C75 (Warm Taupe)
  - Accent: #A84B2B (Muted Terracotta/Fired Clay)
  - Borders: rgba(28, 27, 26, 0.12)
- Typography: Use 'Instrument Serif' (for massive, elegant headings with italicized words) and 'Manrope' (for crisp UI text) via Google Fonts. STRICTLY NO Inter or Roboto.
- Icons: Use Phosphor Icons via CDN (Light and Fill weights). Do NOT use Lucide.
- Image Treatment (CRITICAL): Apply a global CSS filter to all Unsplash placeholder images to force them into the earthy palette: `filter: grayscale(80%) sepia(15%) hue-rotate(345deg) contrast(1.1) brightness(0.9);`. Transition to brighter contrast/less grayscale on hover.

2. GLOBAL EFFECTS & BACKGROUND ARCHITECTURE
- Noise Overlay: Add a fixed SVG fractal noise overlay (opacity 0.35, pointer-events none) for an analogue print texture.
- Background Depth: Include an Unsplash texture image with `mix-blend-mode: multiply` and `opacity: 0.12`.
- Drafting Grid: A CSS background grid (using linear-gradients) masked with a radial-gradient fading out at the edges.
- Vertical Lines: Exactly 5 vertical baseline grid lines (1px width) spanning the container, animated to scaleY(1) on scroll.
- Giant Typography: Floating background text (e.g., "ATELIER") at `25vw` font size, perfectly centered, `2%` opacity, with parallax scroll.
- Decorative Markers: Absolute positioned plus (+) and asterisk (*) icons in the background, one slowly spinning.

3. ADVANCED ASYMMETRICAL LAYOUT (12-Column Grid)
Build a highly creative CSS grid featuring these 4 exact components. DO NOT make generic symmetrical boxes:
1. "The Tall Editorial": A tall image spanning multiple rows vertically. The image mask must have an arched top-left corner (`border-radius: 200px 2px 2px 2px`). Overlap a Surface-colored content box on the bottom right corner (breaking outside the image bounds) with meta tags ("01 Methodology") and a title.
2. "The Dark Abstract Block": A dark charcoal box. Inside, add topographic background lines via CSS repeating-radial-gradient. Include a "Discover" Magnetic Button (a circular outline button with absolute positioning logic in JS that smoothly pulls towards the mouse on hover).
3. "The Detail Overlap": A smaller card overlapping the tall editorial. Attach a continuously spinning circular SVG text seal ("• BESPOKE CRAFT • RAW MATERIALITY" using `<textPath>`) halfway off the edge, with a sparkle icon in the center.
4. "The Interactive List": A full-width row at the bottom. Left side: large italicized heading. Right side: A list of 3 items separated by borders. CRITICAL: Hovering a list row must translate the text to the right, turn it terracotta, rotate the icon, AND reveal a floating image that instantly follows the user's cursor across the viewport.

4. ANIMATIONS & MICRO-INTERACTIONS (GSAP)
Import GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and Split-Type. Implement the following:
- Custom Cursor: Hide default cursor. Create a custom cursor with a terracotta dot and a 40px outline ring. Use `gsap.quickTo` for zero-lag tracking. Expand the ring and add a backdrop-blur on interactive elements. On images, turn the ring solid charcoal, hide the dot, and reveal the text "VIEW".
- Hover Reveal Image: Use `gsap.quickTo` to make an absolutely positioned, hidden image follow the cursor when hovering over the methodology list rows. Change the image `src` based on the hovered row.
- Magnetic Logic: Write JS to calculate `clientX/Y` relative to the "Discover" button's bounding box so the button and text smoothly pull towards the cursor.
- Text Reveal: Split the main headline and reveal word-by-word from `translateY(115%)` with `overflow: hidden` wrappers on scroll.
- Scroll Animations: Reveal images using smooth `clip-path: inset(100% 0 0 0)`. Add smooth parallax (`yPercent`) to the background image, giant background text, and grid images.

### 5. EXECUTION
Code must be semantic, production-ready, and fully responsive (stack grid to 1 column and disable custom cursor/hover reveals on touch devices). Write professional, poetic architectural copywriting (e.g. "Orchestrating Silent Volumes"). Start writing the HTML immediately.
